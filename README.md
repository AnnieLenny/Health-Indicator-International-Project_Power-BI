# Health Indicators & Life Expectancy Analysis Across Countries in Power BI

In this project, I used **Power BI** to analyze how different health indicators across countries affect life expectancy. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract valuable insights. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach I followed.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Approach:

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - **Dataset: I obtained a dataset containing health indicators and life expectancy data across multiple countries.
   - **Data Cleaning**:
     - Removed inconsistencies, errors, and duplicate entries to ensure the data was accurate and reliable.
     - Used **Power Query Editor** to handle missing values, correct formatting, and clean up the dataset.
     - The cleaned dataset was ready for further analysis after ensuring consistency across the data.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
   - **Creating New Columns**: Transformed the dataset by creating new calculated columns to derive important metrics and insights.
   - **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated the data to summarize key statistics, such as average life expectancy by country, health indicators, and their relationships.
   - **Power Query Editor**: Used the Power Query Editor to further refine the data, group it by key metrics, and prepare it for visualization.

### 3. **Data Import & Setup in Power BI**
   - Imported the cleaned and transformed dataset into Power BI using the **Get Data** option.
   - Created relationships between different tables within Power BI to enable a seamless analysis.
   - Defined **data hierarchies** to allow users to drill down into the data for deeper insights.

### 4. **Visualizing the Data**
   - Created a **Table** to display the raw data for reference and further inspection.
   - For visual representation:
     - **Map Visualization**: Used a map to show geographical differences in life expectancy and health indicators across countries.
     - **Bar Chart**: Created bar charts to compare life expectancy and health indicators across different countries.
   - Dragged and dropped relevant fields into the **canvas** to create compelling visuals that highlight the relationships between health indicators and life expectancy.

### 5. **Customizing the Visuals**
   - Customized the appearance of the visuals by adjusting:
     - **Legends**: Added legends for clarity.
     - **Colors**: Applied color schemes for visual appeal and to differentiate between categories.
     - **Labels**: Added clear labels to make the data easy to interpret.
   - Ensured that the visualizations were intuitive and user-friendly, allowing viewers to easily understand the insights.

### 6. **Enhancing Interactivity**
   - Used **Slicers** and **Filters** to provide interactivity, allowing users to filter the data by country, health indicator, or other dimensions.
   - Created an **interactive worksheet** that enables users to explore different segments of the data and drill down into specific areas of interest.

### 7. **Publishing & Sharing**
   - After finalizing the report, I **published** the Power BI dashboard for easy access and sharing with stakeholders.
   - The dashboard can now be accessed online for continuous exploration and analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Power BI**: For data import, transformation, and visualization.
- **Power Query Editor**: For cleaning and shaping the data.
- **Slicers & Filters**: To allow for dynamic interaction with the data.
- **Calculated Columns & Aggregation**: For deriving meaningful metrics and summarizing key statistics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways:
- This project highlights the impact of various health indicators (e.g., infant mortality, healthcare access, lifestyle factors) on life expectancy across countries.
- By using Power BI, I was able to clean, transform, and visualize data in an engaging and insightful way.
- The interactive dashboard enables users to explore the data based on their specific interests and needs.

---

## ðŸ“… Future Improvements:
- Integrating more detailed data sources such as socioeconomic factors, environmental indicators, and healthcare infrastructure to enhance the analysis.
- Incorporating more advanced features like drill-through reports to provide a more granular view of the data.
- Regular updates of the dashboard to ensure it reflects the most current data.
